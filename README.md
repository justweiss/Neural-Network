# Neural Network

Figure 18.19 shows a simple mathematical model of the neuron devised by McCulloch and Pitts (1943). Roughly speaking, it “fires” when a linear combination of its inputs exceeds some (hard or soft) threshold—that is, it implements a linear classifier of the kind described in the preceding section. A neural network is just a collection of units connected together; the properties of the network are determined by its topology and the properties of the “neurons.”
